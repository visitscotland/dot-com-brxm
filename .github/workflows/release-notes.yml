# Issue:
#  - Without permissions:
#     a. Could accidentally allow secret access, PR writes, etc.
#     b. Inherits org/repo defaults (possibly write-all)
#  - With permissions:
#	  a. Explicit, scoped, secure
#	  b. Locked down to release creation only
# Solution:
#  Principle of Least Privilege, explicitly restrict the token's permissions to only what's necessary
permissions:
  contents: write  # ðŸ‘ˆ Minimum required to create a release
