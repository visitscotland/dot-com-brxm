defined by the sub-contract

payment to the Client in respect of 
Services and the sub-contractor’s 
invoice relates to such Services 
then, to that extent, the invoice 
must be treated as valid and,

off in respect of a breach of contract

contractor to the Consultant, 
payment must be made to the sub-

invoice, that matter may be referred 
by the sub-contractor to the 
Purchaser; and

award despite the existence of exclusion 
grounds or a serious infringement of EU 
legal obligations) specified in condition 13.3

a contract between two or more 
contractors, at any stage of remoteness
