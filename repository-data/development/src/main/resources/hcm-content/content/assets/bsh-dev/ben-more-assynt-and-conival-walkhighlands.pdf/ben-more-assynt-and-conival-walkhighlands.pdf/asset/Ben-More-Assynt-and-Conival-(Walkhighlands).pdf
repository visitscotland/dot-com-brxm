Walk Description

STAGE 1
Park at the public car park in front of the Inchnadamph Hotel. The walk begins a short distance further north along the road; follow the A837

over its bridge over the River Trallgill and then turn right onto the private road to Inchnadamph Lodge. This leads past the independent hostel

and field centre and heads through a gate. Ignore a track off left, instead continuing until the glen track crosses the Allt Poll an Droighinn on a

concrete bridge. On the far side you can shortcut a zig-zag by heading straight ahead and rejoining the main track.

STAGE 2
Further on is the isolated white-washed holiday cottage of Glenbain. Continue past Glenbain up the glen, now on a good path, passing to the

right of a plantation after about another kilometre. Shortly after this the path forks; the signed right branch heads for the Traligill caves,

popular with pot-holers, but to continue our route towards the mountains keep left. Keep on the north side of Gleann Dubh, which becomes

narrower and steep sided.

STAGE 3
After 4.5km or so from the start the climb begins in earnest. A boggy section is followed by a badly eroded path climbing up the north side of

the Allt a' Choinne Mhill. Much higher up the gradient relents into a shallow grassy corrie. The path soon crosses the burn and then climbs up

towards the base of a band of quartzite crags. These are most easily ascended as a rocky staircase not far to the right of the burn. There are

a few cairns that may help mark the route.

STAGE 4
Above the line of crags an upper corrie is reached, with the bealach between Conival and Beinn an Fhurain beyond. Now the route begins to

head up the north ridge of Conival on a stony path; there are a fine views looking over into Coire a'Mhadaidh, its lochan overshadowed by the

impressive quartzite buttresses of Na Tuadhan.

STAGE 5
Higher up is a better defined section of ridge, grassy going giving relief from the stones for a while. Beyond this the ridge climbs again, with

some fine crags on the SW side, eventually reaching the summit cairn of Conival at a junction of three ridges. The cairn takes the form of a

wind-shelter and has grand views looking back along Loch Assynt.

STAGE 6
The east ridge leads the eye across masses of scree slopes to Ben More Assynt; traversing the ridge is very rough going and more time

consuming than you might expect. Head east and then descend traces of a path down an initial slope of crags and boulders. There is then a

stony arête before another descent down to the bealach. Beyond this the ridge climbs again with more stones and scree, climbing up to point

974 before descending steeply.

STAGE 7
Climb more stones for the final ascent to the summit of Ben More Assynt. At 998m this is the highest mountain over a vast area of Northern

Scotland as well as being the second Munro of the day; the view is of a majestic, desolate, sweeping bare wilderness in all directions.

STAGE 8
The ridge leading south from Ben More Assynt is said to be a challenging scramble, but would lead many miles from the nearest road.

Instead, retrace your outward route back along the rocky ridge to Conival.

STAGE 9
From the summit of Conival, turn north to continue retracing your steps the way you came, enjoying the superb views over Loch Assynt. Keep

heading back all the way to the bealach and down the glen to return to Inchnadamph.
