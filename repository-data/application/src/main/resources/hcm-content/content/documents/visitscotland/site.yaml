            <ul>
             <li>bundle.resourceKey will retrieve the object from resource bundle with key resourceKey</li>
             <li>bundle("patternKey", arg1, arg2, arg3) will retrieve the string from resource bundle with key patternKey, and will use it as a pattern for MessageFormat with arguments arg1, arg2 and arg3</li>

            <p>A hash model that wraps a resource bundle. Makes it convenient to store localized content in the data model. It also acts as a method model that will take a resource key and arbitrary number of arguments and will apply MessageFormat with arguments on the string represented by the key.</p>

            <p>Typical usages:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>bundle.resourceKey will retrieve the object from resource bundle with key resourceKey</li>
             <li>bundle("patternKey", arg1, arg2, arg3) will retrieve the string from resource bundle with key patternKey, and will use it as a pattern for MessageFormat with arguments arg1, arg2 and arg3</li>
