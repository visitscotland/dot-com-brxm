            hippostd:content: <p>It was in Scotland's capital city that JK Rowling
              started to plot the adventures of Harry and his friends. With cobbled
              streets, winding alleys and medieval architecture, the city certainly
              has a few things in common with the settings from the books and films.
              She wrote the early chapters in various cafés around the city's Old
              Town, before coming back to finish off the series from a peaceful suite
              in The Balmoral Hotel. It is also said that Hogwarts School was styled
              on Edinburgh’s Fettes College, a private school on the outskirts of
              Edinburgh’s west end new town. You could also try the Wizarding World
              of Edinburgh tour.</p>
