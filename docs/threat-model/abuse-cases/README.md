# Cybersecurity Abuse Cases

[OWASP Abuse Case Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Abuse_Case_Cheat_Sheet.html)

An Abuse case can be defined as:

> A way to use a feature that was not expected by the implementer,
allowing an attacker to influence the feature or outcome of use of
the feature based on the attacker action (or input).

Abuse cases are useful when conducting threat models because they give some context about how threat actors might successfully exploit system vulnerabilities.

Synopsys define an Abuse Case like this:

> Misuse and abuse cases describe how users misuse or exploit the weaknesses of controls in software features to attack an application.
>
> This can lead to tangible business impact when a direct attack against business functionalities, which may bring in revenue or provide positive user experience, are attacked.
>
> Abuse cases can also be an effective way to drive security requirements that lead to proper protection of these critical business use cases.
