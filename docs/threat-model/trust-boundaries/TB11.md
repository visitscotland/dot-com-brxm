| Spoofing               | V181 | Attacker impersonates VS helpdesk team (social engineering) to enable attacks on 3rd parties such as collecting user info for sale on the dark web (information disclosure) or spear phishing (elevation of privelege) | V187 | N/A                                                                                         | V193 | N/A                                                                                                                                                              |
