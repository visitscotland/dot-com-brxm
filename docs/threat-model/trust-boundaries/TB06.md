| Tampering              | V092 | Content is modified by an attacker, likely for the purpose of phishing users of VS.COM website                                     | V098 | Feeds, data, and articles modified by third parties after moderators approve content | V104 | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Repudiation            | V093 | Access events are scrubbed or corrupted by an attacker to conceal evidence of an attack                                            | V099 | N/A                                                                                  | V105 | VS Team members do not keep records of their interactions with external aggregators, which makes it harder to trace interactions to determine whether and how a social engineering attack occurred     |
| Information Disclosure | V094 | Sensitive 3rd-Party data such as access credentials, API keys, or user metadata are leaked via attack on 3rd party feed maintainer | V100 | Feeds, data, and articles leaked early                                               | V106 | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Denial of Service      | V095 | Remote feed data is corrupted by attack on 3rd-party feed provider (ransomware of non-VS systems)                                  | V101 | Feeds, data, and articles blocked or rerouted                                        | V107 | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
