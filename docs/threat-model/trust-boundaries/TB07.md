| Spoofing               | V109 | Attacker impersonates user account data store to enable other attacks such as information disclosure (exposing user credentials) or elevation of privilege (gaining access to API keys or tokens) | V115 | N/A                                                                                                                                 | V121 | N/A                                                                                                                                                              |
| Tampering              | V110 | VS.COM auth service container/module tampered with by attacker to always allow access (authentication bypass)                                                                                     | V116 | Web traffic data stream altered                                                                                                     | V122 | Attacker modifies user account info to enable other attacks (resetting user security challenge questions to enable attacker to reset user password, for example) |
| Repudiation            | V111 | Authentication attempt logs scrubbed or corrupted by attacker to conceal evidence of activity (credential stuffing, for example)                                                                  | V117 | N/A                                                                                                                                 | V123 | User data stores' access logs (CRUD operations) scrubbed or corrupted by attacker to conceal evidence of activity                                                |
| Information Disclosure | [V112](../vulnerabilities/V112.md) | Sensitive data such as access tokens, API keys, or IP address/port of backing data stores leaked to attacker (for example via SQL injection to dump backing database table info)                  | V118 | Web traffic data stream sniffed to grab API keys, access tokens, or user information as it is transmitted to/from the auth services | V124 | User account info leaked by attacker, for example the first stage of a ransomware attack (prior to second stage encryption of data stores)                       |
| Denial of Service      | V113 | Authentication service failure caused via DDoS or DNS poisoning, most likely performed by attacker to enable elevation of privilege due to failover state allowing access when it shouldn't       | V119 | Web traffic blocked                                                                                                                 | V125 | User account info databases rendered inaccessible due to internal DDoS attack, ransomware (second stage), or changes to firewall and routing rules               |
| Elevation of Privilege | V114 | VS.COM auth service bypassed or taken over via SQL injection (RCE) or buffer overflow attacks                                                                                                     | V120 | N/A                                                                                                                                 | V126 | N/A                                                                                                                                                              |
