Identifying credible threat actors helps give important context to threat modelers using a [risk-based approach](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/risk-management-collection/essential-topics/get-basics-right-risk-management-principles-cyber-security). For example, if it is unlikely that a nation-state level threat actor would take an interest in a product or service, there is no point spending effort identifying vulnerabilities, mitigations, and incident response playbooks related to nation-state level abuse cases.

Threat actors can be documented in the 'threat-actors' directory using the [threat actor Markdown template](threat-actor-template.md)
