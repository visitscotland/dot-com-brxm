# Threat Model Reviews

[Agile Threat Modelling](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-threat-modelling.html) treats threat model reviews similarly to typical code reviews and encourages teams to construct threat models in small chunks, brick-by-brick:

> Start threat modelling 'little and often'. 
>
> Each threat modelling session with the team should be short and focussed enough to be quickly digested into something that can be delivered. Start by analysing the thinnest slice of your system possible; just what you are working on right now. Rather than trying to analyse your entire system upfront, build your team's muscle memory with threat modelling a little bit at a time.
>
> Practises which require a completely specified software design do not match how agile teams work. There is no reason why threat modelling needs to be an exhaustive upfront analysis. Too often teams are overwhelmed by comprehensive and highly structured approaches to threat modelling.
>
> Rather than creating and maintaining an exhaustive 'threat model' document, do threat modelling 'little and often'. When you work this way each threat modelling session is tiny, having little impact. Yet the cumulative effect of doing them has a huge impact. When you know you'll be doing this again every iteration, there's less incentive to try to do everything at once and more incentive to prioritize the most important work right now.

Threat model reviews should documented using this [review template](review-template.md) and reviews generally should result in at least one concrete task added to the team's backlog.
