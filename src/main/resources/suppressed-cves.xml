            Pivotal Spring Framework through 5.3.16 suffers from a potential remote code execution (RCE) issue if used
            for Java deserialization of untrusted data. Depending on how the library is implemented within a product,
            this issue may or not occur, and authentication may be required. NOTE: the vendor's position is that
            untrusted data is not an intended use case. The product's behavior will not be changed because some users
            rely on deserialization of trusted data.

            The mentioned vulnerability is actually for quartz-jobs but brXM only has quartz and therefore this is
            considered a false positive.
